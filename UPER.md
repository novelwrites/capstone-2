    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*
*Interview client, define expectations, and obtain items needed to implement solution: 
TEKcamp Logo for GUI (supplied by classmate Abigail Swigert)
 Color Scheme and Layout: Customer Approved
 Review Features Wish List with customer and prioritize items
 GUI details to be displayed: Customer Approved 
 Set realistic and achievable goals: Prioritize client requests and identify areas of difficulty that will need to be addressed while keeping in mind current level of technical expertise, resources available and time frame
 Define specific times to provide soft skill training for teammates and incorporate into my schedule / provide a PowerPoint in the help channel on presentation tips that students can view in their own time

*Preliminary Planning
*
*Projected Daily Goals:
Day One: Review Capstone Documentation provided by instructor. Research games and examine existing code to understand how to implement functionality. Locate resources to aid in creating game. Finalize game selection. 
Day Two: Define problem and begin to plan how to solve it. Complete Step One and Two of UPER. Work on OOP documentation per capstone requirements.
Day Three: Review Feature List from Customer Requirements. Brainstorm Structure with Classes/Objects needed to fulfill MVP. Continue to work on OOP documentation. Research pong code and try to understand how it works. Identify trouble areas and research.
Day Four: Begin coding basic structure. identify problem areas and prioritize time according to what can be accomplished while waiting on resources needed to accomplish tasks in the queue. Research what is needed to accomplish Features Wish List
Day Five – Six: Continue coding and work on coding items from Features Wish List in order of priority. Work on refactoring and debugging.
Day Seven: Address and Resolve any Coding Issues. Complete Documentation. Prepare slides from notes and practice presentation.

    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*The process for implementing my plan was very fluid, making adjustments as needed. I needed to study a lot of code and spend time with my friend who is a java developer – he patiently explained concepts that would help me understand and implement my code. My learning curve for the software coding required was my biggest blocker. I prioritized my coding time (what I worked on) according to: 
A. MVP
B. Current technical ability and how much research required to implement the task
C. Length of time of blocker (which leads to D.)
D. Availability of support and other students for collaboration
 Thank you to everyone at TEKAcademy and our cohort – just as in Capstone 1,  the responsiveness of the TEKacademy faculty, the spirit of collaboration among students, and everyone’s desire to help each other succeed was amazing! I especially appreciate the folks from TEKsystems who offered their time and knowledge freely, well-past normal working hours, to anyone who needed help.

I did my project in stages, with my first goal being to accomplish basic functionality. I then worked on the customer features list which was a lot of fun. It took much research and I am amazed at the classes and methods that are available in java and what you can do with them once you are aware they exist. I learned about inheritance and spent a lot of time playing with methods from different classes, especially the Graphics class, and JFrames, and learning about modal dialogue boxes. I created three classes: Paddle, Ball, and GameDriver and learned about threads and how to create and execute threads. I could go on and on...
It seems to me that java is extremely powerful in its functionality and very challenging because it is so strongly typed but that the more you use it, the more intuitive it will become.  I big part of my success as a test engineer for a semiconductor manufacturer was not that I knew how to do everything, but that I knew how to get the information I needed to accomplish my task. I believe that is a successful strategy for any endeavor – and part of the fun of the task is learning new things. I had a lot of help in understanding concepts for this project and I am grateful for all of the resources that were available – human and google. 

MY SOLUTION TO CODING AND EVERYTHING IN LIFE: You don’t need to know everything, you just need to know how to find out what you need to know...

I struggled for many hours studying examples, trying to code this game and implement the items on my Features Wish List and knew I needed help. I needed to understand how to instantiate a class better – how to create new objects from the ”blueprint” to implement the functionality  I needed. I decided to ask a friend who is a java developer to help me understand the important concepts I needed to know to get the code to work. My Daddy always said, “If you don’t know it’s simply awful and if you do know it’s awfully simple.” He understood my desire to write the code myself with some needed guidance. We met via Zoom and reviewed the code together, discussing the importance of OOP concepts and program structure. When I got stuck he provided some direction. I am thrilled to say that through our collaboration I was able to complete the capstone and I learned so much along the way! None of us are an island - we are better together! 
Special Thanks to my friend, Jamil, for his patience with all of my questions, his great explanations, and for his guidance as I worked on the code.

Testing Phase

I drafted my husband and we had a lot of fun testing out the game. We made sure the dialogue boxes functioned correctly and that the string text began passed to the dialogue box and on the GUI was uniform with no misspellings. We played around with optimum paddle sizes and colors, the size of the ball and ball speed.
We also needed to test the score keeping, and we let the program run to see if it would crash and if the score would continue to increment. The figure below is from an earlier reiteration of the code. Testing also helped me to determine what I needed to do to improve the code.

    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*
Capstone 2 has been a great learning opportunity. The intensity of the boot camp doesn’t permit students the luxury of repetition on learning concepts  and to say these past weeks have been challenging is an understatement. But there is a lot to be said regarding being challenged. It is through challenges that we learn to find our strength, to dig deeper than we have in the past, and to persevere even when it hurts. It is also an opportunity to reach out and support and encourage those around us. I love people and I love technology and I got to deepen some relationships and begin new ones while beginning to learn a very fun new language. It has been an incredible experience.
Measurable outcomes
Tangible:
Was the criteria set forth in the assignment met? The 2D terminal game Pong meets the basic criteria for the assignment. 
The Kliskey family is very happy at having a pong computer game that all four of their children can play simultaneously 

Intangible: 
It was a tremendous learning opportunity that also has me very excited about future learning and growth. The relationships I have already formed in TEKcamp deepened and I made some new wonderful relationships as well.
I have to say it again because it is so true...“If you don’t know it’s simply awful, if you do know, it’s awfully simple.” I will never forget this experience. It was challenging, exhausting, exhilarating, frustrating, exciting. I also found that I had reserves within me that I didn’t know existed when it came time to make a choice of persevering or giving up. The right answer always is: If I don’t know, I can find out.
What would I do different? Not so much different but I will definitely continue to learn, continue to grow, and continue to develop relationships so that we can help each other to succeed. I know that the code I wrote this week is not the code I will be able to write next week, the week after, or two years from now. Having a flexible mindset and learning from my mistakes is a lifelong characteristic I will try my best to cultivate. I will not settle for ordinary but in regards to my rather ordinary-looking 2D game, I have much to celebrate regarding the learning, the investment by other students and TEK Academy faculty and friends that brought me to a place I could never have imagined a scant nine weeks ago.
