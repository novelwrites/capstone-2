TEKcamp Pong Instructions

Pong was created by Allan Alcorn for Atari, a table tennis game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, which was originally released in 1972. This special TEKcamp version was created in response to the need for a 4 Player version.

Paddle designations:

2 Player Mode:
Red (outer left side of screen)
Blue (outer right side of screen)

Additional Paddles for 4 Player Mode:
Orange (inner left side of screen)
Magenta (inner right side of screen)

In order to play: Launch game

1.	Select 2 Player Mode or 4 Player Mode.
2.	Enter Player Names when prompted.
3.	Game will automatically begin when you click enter for last player name entered.
4.	Use the two up/down keys assigned to your paddle to move your paddle along the y-axis of the screen. The goal is to hit the ball with your paddle to return the ball towards your opponent and not to allow the ball to get past your paddle and hit the wall. If this happens, the ball will bounce off the wall and move towards your opponent’s side and your opponent’s score will increment. Play is continuous.
5.	4 Player mode allows for team play. Each player can move their paddle along the y-axis and just like in regular tennis, either player can attempt to hit the ball with their paddle. Team members can coordinate their play strategy if desired.
